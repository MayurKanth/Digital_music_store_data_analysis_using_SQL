# Digital_music_store_data_analysis_using_SQL

I completed a SQL project where i tried to solve some business questions like finding out the senior most employee,countries having the most invoices,top3 values of invoices, city which generated highest amount of money and other business problems like that.

Thus project involves the application of concepts and clauses like Order By, Limit, Sub-Query, Joins, Window functions like Dense_Rank etc.
